# shopt

The list of shopt options is:

## assoc_expand_once
If set, the shell suppresses multiple evaluation of associative 
array subscripts during arithmetic expression evaluation, 
while executing builtins that can perform variable assignments, and 
while executing builtins that perform array dereferencing.

## autocd
If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is 
executed as if it were the argument to the `cd` command. 
This option is only used by interactive shells.

## cdable_vars
If this is set, an argument to the `cd` builtin command 
that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of 
a variable whose value is the directory to change to.

## cdspell
If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component 
in a `cd` command will be corrected. 
The errors checked for are
- transposed characters, 
- a missing character, and 
- a character too many. 
If a correction is found, the corrected path is printed, and the 
command proceeds. This option is only used by interactive shells.

## checkhash
If this is set, Bash checks that a command found in the hash table 
exists before trying to execute it. 
If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.

## checkjobs
If set, Bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before 
exiting an interactive shell. If any jobs are running, this causes 
the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without 
an intervening command. 
The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.

## checkwinsize
If set, Bash checks the window size after each external (non-builtin) command 
and, if necessary, updates the values of LINES and COLUMNS. 
This option is enabled by default.

## cmdhist
If set, Bash attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command 
in the same history entry. 
This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands. 
This option is enabled by default, but only has an effect 
if command history is enabled.

## compatibility options
compat31
compat32
compat40
compat41
compat42
compat43
compat44
These control aspects of the shell's compatibility mode.

## complete_fullquote
If set, Bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names 
when performing completion. If not set, Bash removes metacharacters such as 
the dollar sign from the set of characters that will be quoted in completed 
filenames when these metacharacters appear in shell variable references in 
words to be completed. This means that dollar signs in variable names that 
expand to directories will not be quoted; however, any dollar signs appearing 
in filenames will not be quoted, either. This is active only when bash is 
using backslashes to quote completed filenames. 
This variable is set by default, 
which is the default Bash behavior in versions through 4.2.

## direxpand
If set, Bash replaces directory names with the results of word expansion 
when performing filename completion. This changes the contents of the 
Readline editing buffer. 
If not set, Bash attempts to preserve what the user typed.

## dirspell
If set, Bash attempts spelling correction on directory names during word 
completion if the directory name initially supplied does not exist.

## dotglob
If set, Bash includes filenames beginning with a '.' in the results of 
filename expansion. 
The filenames '.' and '..' must always be matched explicitly, 
even if `dotglob` is set.

## execfail
If this is set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute 
the file specified as an argument to the exec builtin command. 
An interactive shell does not exit if exec fails.

## expand_aliases
If set, aliases are expanded as described. 
This option is enabled by default for interactive shells.

## extdebug
If set at shell invocation, or in a shell startup file, 
arrange to execute the debugger profile before the shell starts, 
identical to the `--debugger` option. 
If set after invocation, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
- `-F` option to the declare builtin displays the source file name and 
  line number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.
- If the command run by the `DEBUG` trap returns a non-zero value, 
  the next command is skipped and not executed.
- If the command run by the `DEBUG` trap returns a value of 2, 
  and the shell is executing in a subroutine (a shell function or a shell 
  script executed by `.` builtins), the shell simulates a call to return.
- `BASH_ARGC` and `BASH_ARGV` are updated as described in their descriptions.
- Function tracing is enabled: 
  - command substitution
  - shell functions
  - subshells invoked with `( command )` inherit `DEBUG` and `RETURN` traps.
- Error tracing is enabled:
  - command substitution
  - shell functions
  - subshells invoked with `( command )` inherit the `ERR` trap.


## extglob
If set, the extended pattern matching are enabled.

## extquote
If set, `$'string'` and `$"string"` quoting is performed 
within `${parameter}` expansions enclosed in double quotes. 
This option is enabled by default.

## failglob
If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during 
filename expansion result in an expansion error.

## force_fignore
If set, the suffixes specified by `FIGNORE` shell variable cause words to 
be ignored when performing word completion even if the ignored words are 
the only possible completions. 
See Bash Variables, for a description of FIGNORE. 
This option is enabled by default.

## globasciiranges
If set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket expressions 
behave as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.
That is, the current locale's collating sequence is not taken into account, 
so 'b' will not collate between 'A' and 'B', 
and upper-case and lower-case ASCII characters will collate together.

## globskipdots
If set, filename expansion will never match the filenames '.' and '..', 
even if the pattern begins with a '.'. This option is enabled by default.

## globstar
If set, the pattern `**` used in a filename expansion context will match all files 
and zero or more directories and subdirectories. 
If the pattern is followed by a `/`, only directories and subdirectories match.

## gnu_errfmt
If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.

## histappend
If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the HISTFILE 
variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.

## histreedit
If set, and Readline is being used, a user is given 
the opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.

## histverify
If set, and Readline is being used, the results of history 
substitution are not immediately passed to the shell parser. 
Instead, the resulting line is loaded into Readline 
editing buffer, allowing further modification.

## hostcomplete
If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will attempt to perform 
hostname completion when a word containing a `@` is being completed. 
This option is enabled by default.

## huponexit
If set, Bash will send `SIGHUP` to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

## inherit_errexit
If set, command substitution inherits the value of the errexit option, instead of unsetting 
it in the subshell environment. This option is enabled when POSIX mode is enabled.

## interactive_comments
Allow a word beginning with `#` to cause that word and all remaining characters on that 
line to be ignored in an interactive shell. This option is enabled by default.

## lastpipe
If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline 
not executed in the background in the current shell environment.

## lithist
If enabled, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history 
with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.

## localvar_inherit
If set, local variables inherit the value and attributes of a variable of the same name 
that exists at a previous scope before any new value is assigned. 
The nameref attribute is not inherited.

## localvar_unset
If set, calling unset on local variables in previous function scopes marks 
them so subsequent lookups find them unset until that function returns. 
This is identical to the behavior of unsetting 
local variables at the current function scope.

## login_shell
The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell. 
The value may not be changed.

## mailwarn
If set, and a file that Bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the last 
time it was checked, the message "The mail in mailfile has been read" is displayed.

## no_empty_cmd_completion
If set, and Readline is being used, Bash will not attempt to search the PATH 
for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.

## nocaseglob
If set, Bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing filename expansion.

## nocasematch
If set, Bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching 
- while executing case or [[ conditional commands,  
- when performing pattern substitution word expansions, or 
- when filtering possible completions as part of programmable completion.

## noexpand_translation
If set, Bash encloses the translated results of $"..." quoting in single quotes 
instead of double quotes. If the string is not translated, this has no effect.

## nullglob
If set, Bash allows filename patterns which match no files to expand to a null string, 
rather than themselves.

## patsub_replacement
If set, Bash expands occurrences of '&' in the replacement string of pattern substitution 
to the text matched by the pattern, as described above. 
This option is enabled by default.

## progcomp
If set, the programmable completion facilities are enabled. 
This option is enabled by default.

## progcomp_alias
If set, and programmable completion is enabled, Bash treats a command name 
that doesn't have any completions as a possible alias and attempts alias expansion. 
If it has an alias, Bash attempts programmable completion using the command 
word resulting from the expanded alias.

## promptvars
If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, 
arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described 
below. This option is enabled by default.

## restricted_shell
The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode. 
The value may not be changed. 
This is not reset when the startup files are executed, allowing the startup files to 
discover whether or not a shell is restricted.

## shift_verbose
If this is set, the shift builtin prints an error message 
when the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.

## sourcepath
If set, the . (source) builtin uses the value of PATH to find the directory 
containing the file supplied as an argument. This option is enabled by default.

## varredir_close
If set, the shell automatically closes file descriptors assigned using the {varname} 
redirection syntax instead of leaving them open when the command completes.

## xpg_echo
If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.
